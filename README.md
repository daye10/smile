## About The Project
> **Note:** SMILE is built with the community in mind. It strictly avoids interfering with other players' experience. The bot is designed for PvE content only and intentionally does **not** automate or support competitive features like the World Tournament.

SMILE farm tool is a reverse-engineered Python bot designed to automate gameplay in **Dragon Ball Z: Dokkan Battle**, a mobile gacha RPG. It simulates user behavior and decision-making to handle full gameplay loops without manual input.

The bot does far more than just repeating scheduled runs—it handles dynamic gameplay decisions, team setup, item usage, event-specific conditions, and resource management. It's tailored to reduce user grind by optimizing efficiency and supporting a wide range of in-game farming content.

The bot's source code is intentionally kept **private** to prevent abuse, misuse, or exploitation of Dokkan's systems and APIs by malicious users.

If you’re curious about how it works or have questions about capabilities, you're welcome to reach out  directly via Discord!
